# Fruits-Database-EDA-and-API-Data-Aquisition
Exploratory Data Analysis project of a Postgre-SQL database built using data gathered from the Fruityvice API at https://www.fruityvice.com/

The project has been entirely carried out inside Python Notebooks by extracting data from the API, then setting up the pipeline to build the database tables and subsequently query data from the Postgre-SQL database.
